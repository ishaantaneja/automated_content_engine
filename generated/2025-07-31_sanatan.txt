 1. In the dance of life, you waltz with Maya's spell,
   Seek not transient joys, but the eternal well.
   The Self within shines like a hidden sun,
   In stillness, find your essence, one by one.

2. Like a river flows to the vast ocean deep,
   So the soul yearns for its original sleep.
   In every breath, a whisper of the Gita,
   Find peace in action, find freedom in it.

3. Lost in illusion, seeker wandering far,
   Turn within, the light of truth awaits star.
   The path is not easy, but the goal is sweet,
   In Paramhansa's words, find solace and heat.

4. In the maze of Maya, lost souls run amok,
   Awake, O seeker! Your journey's not a yolk.
   Within you lies the wisdom ancient and new,
   Unveil the Self, end the cycle anew.
