 1: In the heart of Siberia, a city named Norilsk houses the world's northernmost brewery. Yet, it's not beer they're pouring, but nitric acid, sulfuric acid, and other hazardous chemicals. (Pause for effect) The air here is so polluted, it could be mistaken for smog from a megacity... but Norilsk has fewer inhabitants than Central Park on a sunny day.

2: Deep within the Amazon rainforest lies a town named Santar√©m. A peculiar sight greets its visitors: an abandoned city submerged in the river, complete with buildings, streets, and even cars. (Pause for effect) This is Iranduba, drowned under the waters of the Amazon in 1989 to make way for a hydroelectric dam... a ghost town that still stands, swallowed by time and water.
