    "motivation": "Ignore narration and formatting. Write 4–6 raw spoken lines for a 30-second YouTube Shorts script. Speak directly to the viewer like you're shaking them out of sleep. Make it bold, powerful, and honest. No fluff. No characters. No storytelling.",
    "ai_tools": "Ignore ad formatting. Just write 4–6 raw spoken lines for a YouTube Shorts script about a free AI tool that saves time or makes money. No title. No narration. No 'on-screen' instructions. No scene descriptions. Just talk to the viewer like a person sharing a powerful secret. Make it real, fast, and punchy.",
    "sanatan": "Ignore formatting. Write 4–6 poetic and powerful spoken lines inspired by Bhagavad Gita, Sanatan Dharma, or Paramhansa Yogananda. Speak like a modern-day sage revealing timeless truth to someone lost in illusion. No narration. No names. Just ancient power through modern voice.",
    "history": "Forget storytelling. Just give 4–6 raw spoken lines sharing a shocking historical or crime fact. Hook hard in the first line. Make the delivery fast, dark, and real — like a whispered secret from the past. No titles, no narration, no characters. Just words that hit.",
    "facts": "Give 2–3 insane, little-known facts in 4–6 spoken lines. Start with something that slaps. Talk like you're dropping forbidden knowledge. No narration. No titles. No lists. Just fast, mysterious, brain-popping info that keeps them watching till the end."
